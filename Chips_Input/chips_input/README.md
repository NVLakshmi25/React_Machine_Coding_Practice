A chips input component in React allows users to input multiple values (like tags, emails, or keywords) into a single field, displaying each entry as a "chip" or "tag" that can be individually removed. You can build a custom one using React hooks or use pre-built components from UI libraries. 

🎯 Final Answer

👉 90% chance: your input already has a value, so placeholder doesn’t appear.
